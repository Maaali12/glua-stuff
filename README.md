# S&Box application
Hello!
I can't edit my Application at the Forum, so I'm writing something here!
My name is Mali and I want to tell more about myself.
I'm currently in Germany, and I'm working  on a Gmod Star Wars Roleplay Server.
Star Wars Roleplay is in Germany still very Popular, but the most servers are trash. The Performance is not good or
the gameplay is very weak.
As a big Star Wars fan, I want to create something new, something better than all server currently have.
A mix from story telling, roleplay and PVP/PVE.
At the beginning of the developing, i just looked what other servers have. I played a lot and can say that
the most servers are pay 2 win and very laggy. You know if someone wants to raid if the server is laggy and the try hards are switching teams.
For me, it was not roleplay. Only a bad version of Star Wars Battlefront II and some RP elements.
I want to create a story telling System and a lot of RP, but gmod has sadly too much engine limits.
The Performance is not great, graphics sucks and so much more.
My first experience with S&box was that I played Half Life Alyx.
A Amazing game. The graphics and the features are amazing.
I searched for the engine Frome Half Life Alyx and saw Source 2 and all the games that use Source 2.
S&Box.
Thats my little stroy.

Now I want to talk about my goals with the Source 2 engine and S&Box.
I want to create different game modes.

# 1. Half Life Sky
A game like Diablo 3/4 but in the Half Life universe.
The game plays after half Life Alyx

# 2. Shit Jump and run games.
Yeah, just want to create a Jump and run game xd

# 3. Star Wars Roleplay
I want to create that gamemode that gmod doesn't allow to great well.

That are my goals. I hope to get access.

At this Repo are just a few things because i don't want to share all of my codes.

PS: Thanks Garry for creating Garrys Mod!
Thanks for that great childhood with this game.
